# Spot-The-Difference:
It is a game based on discovering the difference between two images, depending on accuracy and focus.

## Game building:
1- An interface was built that receives two images and contains a download button and a level selection button, and displays the timer, number of attempts, and the number of detected and remaining differences.

2- The player selects the level and then selects the images to play.

3-The first level is very simple, while the second level has a timer, and the third level, which has a timer and points, is more difficult.

4-Sound and visual effects were also created.
